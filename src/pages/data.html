<h1>Power Spectra</h1>

<h2>Matter Power Spectra</h2>
<p>
The total matter power spectra (calculated using all particle types, including neutrinos) can be downloaded for all simulations from 
<a href="https://ftp.strw.leidenuniv.nl/FLAMINGO/power_spectra/" class="active text-decoration-none">https://ftp.strw.leidenuniv.nl/FLAMINGO/power_spectra/</a>.
The data from each simulation is contained within an HDF5 file. Each file contains the power spectra for 123 different redshifts. 
For each redshift we store the wavenumber, <i>k</i>, and the corresponding shot-noise subtracted power, <i>P(k)</i>. 
The wavenumber has units of comoving Mpc<sup>-1</sup> (note there is <b>no</b> factor of <i>h</i>), and the power has units of comoving Mpc<sup>3</sup>. 
The shot noise is stored as an attribute for each redshift, and also has units of comoving Mpc<sup>3</sup>.
The following is an example python script for loading and plotting the power spectra for the L1_m9 simulation:

<p>
A description of each run, including cosmological parameters, can be found on the 
<a href="simulations.html" class="active text-decoration-none">simulations page</a>. To find the dark matter only equivalent of a hydrodynamical simulation, 
look for the run in the list of dark matter only simulations which has the same cosmology, box size, and number of particles. The power spectra do contain 
some small artifacts (such as the small peak in the middle of the z=2 line in the example) which are due to combining foldings, and are not real.

If you use the power spectra in a publication, then please cite the FLAMINGO project description paper (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.526.4978S/abstract" class="active text-decoration-none">Schaye+23</a>) and the paper presenting the power spectra (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv241017109S/abstract" class="active text-decoration-none">Schaller+24</a>). If the calibration of the subgrid feedback is mentioned, then please cite the paper describing how the calibration was done (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.526.6103K/abstract" class="active text-decoration-none">Kugel+23</a>).

<h2>Baryonic response emulator</h2>

<!--TODO: Add link to PyPI webpage-->
<p>
<!--The effect of baryons on the matter power spectrum for all the simulations varying feedback in the FLAMINGO-->
<!--suite is presented in the form of a Gaussian process emulator encapsulated in a python package. -->
<!--It is available via PyPI index (<code> pip install FlamingoBaryonResponseEmulator </code>) or from -->
<!--<a href="https://github.com/FLAMINGOSIM/FlamingoBaryonResponseEmulator" class="active text-decoration-none">github</a>,-->
<!--where full documentation is also available.-->
A Gaussian process emulator to model the effect of baryons on the matter power spectrum for all the simulations varying feedback in the FLAMINGO
suite has been developed as part of <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv241017109S/abstract" class="active text-decoration-none">Schaller+24</a>.
Upon acceptance of the paper it shall become publically available via PyPI index and on github.
</p>

<p>
The emulator can be used to predict the deviation of the matter power spectrum for the hydrodynamical simulation 
from the corresponding dark matter only simulation due to baryon and galaxy formation physics.
<!--The package is described by -->
<!--<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv241017109S/abstract" class="active text-decoration-none">Schaller+24</a>. -->
The response as a function of wavenumber <i>k</i> is returned
by the emulator as a function of redshift and three parameters characterizing the galaxy and cluster properties 
in the simulations. These are (i) the offset in the gas fraction in clusters from the Xray-based data used for 
the calibration of the simulations, (ii) the offset in the galaxy masses from the stellar mass function data
used for the calibration, and (iii) the fraction of the AGN feedback taking place in the form of collimated
jets as opposed to thermally-driven winds. The emulator is accurate to better than 1% for redshifts lower than 2 
and for comoving scales up to <i>k</i>=10<i>h</i>/Mpc.
Evaluation of the response for a given model is fast (1ms on 1 CPU core).
