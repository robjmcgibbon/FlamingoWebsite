<p>FLAMINGO is a project of the <a href="https://virgo.dur.ac.uk/" class="active text-decoration-none">
    Virgo consortium</a> for cosmological supercomputer simulations. The acronym stands for Full-hydro 
    Large-scale structure simulations with All-sky Mapping for the Interpretation of Next Generation 
    Observations.</p>

<p>Observational cosmology based on measurements of the growth of large-scale structure is increasingly 
    limited by the accuracy of theoretical predictions. The models that are compared with the data are 
    nearly always based on dark matter only (DMO) simulations, though some allow for marginalization 
    over expected baryonic effects associated with galaxy formation. However, baryonic effects become 
    increasingly important as observations move to smaller scales, and may be considerably more complex 
    than is assumed in the corrections applied to DMO simulations. Hydrodynamical simulations can in 
    principle help resolve this issue, but they tend to use volumes that are too small to study 
    large-scale structure, they often do not reproduce the relevant observables, and/or they do not 
    include model variations that cover the relevant parameter space. The FLAMINGO project aims to 
    address these shortcomings.</p>
<p>Key features:<ul>
    <li>Three resolutions: high/m8 (baryonic particle mass m<sub>g</sub> = 1.3 x 10<sup>8</sup> M<sub>&#9737;</sub>), intermediate/m9 (m<sub>g</sub> = 1.1 x 10<sup>9</sup> M<sub>&#9737;</sub>), and low/m10 (m<sub>g</sub> = 8.6 x 10<sup>9</sup> M<sub>&#9737;</sub>)</li>
    <li>Flagship simulations: 2.8 Gpc box size at m9 resolution (L2p8_m9) and 1 Gpc at m8 resolution (L1_m8)</li>
    <li>Up to 3 x 10<sup>11</sup> particles (2 x 5040<sup>3</sup> + 2800<sup>3</sup>)</li>
    <li>Subgrid feedback is calibrated to the z=0 galaxy stellar mass function and low-z cluster gas fractions using Gaussian process emulation</li>
    <li>Massive neutrinos are modeled using particles with the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507.2614E/abstract" class="active text-decoration-none">'&delta;f' method</a> that was designed to reduce shot noise</li>
    <li>Twelve L1_m9 variations: eight simulations varying the calibration data and four varying the cosmology</li>
    <li>Full-sky lightcone particle data and HEALPix maps for up to 8 different observer locations</li>
    <li>Run with the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13380" class="active text-decoration-none">Swift</a> code and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.2367B/abstract" class="active text-decoration-none">SPHENIX</a> smoothed particle hydrodynamics implementation</li>
    <li>3-fluid initial conditions with separate transfer functions for CDM, baryons and neutrinos, perturbing particle masses rather than positions to suppress discreteness noise</li>
